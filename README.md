Auto Hotkeys for Elite: Dangerous

By Kami-Kaze

# Installing
- Requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.10 or later
- Run `pip-install -r deps` from a terminal (twice if the first one fails)

# Setup
Either run `python setup.py` from a terminal and follow the instructions to set the key binds

Or set the following key binds yourself (I recommend using the secondary bind)
> - Flight Assist: F9
> - Drive Assist: F10
> - Landing Gear: F11
> NB: All of these should be set to toggle, not hold

# Usage
- Navigate to where the `main.pyw` is located
- Run `pythonw main.pyw` from a terminal
- Give it a second, and you should see the following window:

The top row of (green) buttons are toggles, to enable different features and the app itself,
just click them to disable/enable a feature.

Below is some information on what the program is reading from ED.

The app minimizes to tray (Close, closes it!)

Clicking the tray icon shows the app, right-clicking it gives the option to close the app
